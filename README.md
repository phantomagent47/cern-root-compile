# cern-root-compile
Makefile for C++ Projects which use Cern Root Libraries

If you get errors like "root-config" no such file in directory, try this:

type in in terminal

this will open a bash hidden file
gedit ~/.bashrc 

add this line at the end of bash file
source /path to root/bin/thisroot.sh 

replace path to root with full path to your root dir where you installed it
